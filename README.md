# Concurrency Assignment 2023
# Project Name: Club Simulation

## Description

The club simulation program simulates a club environment, much like in real life. 

## Features

- **Club Goer:** A club goer can enter the club, unless the maximum capacity is reached, then it must wait outside the club.
                 Once inside the club, a club goer can get drinks from the bar, wander around, or dance on the dance floor.
                 If a club goer leaves, a club goer may enter from the waiting line, thus reaching the maximum specified limit once again.
- **Terminal Inputs:** The user may provide their own terminal inputs, via the makefile, to have as many club goers as they would like, and to place their
                      own limit on the amount of club goers inside the club.
                      The user cna also specify the number of x and y gridcells via the make file.
  
## Usage

1. Download the file to a local storage space on your PC
2. Change the command line inputs in the 'run' method of the makefile, if you wish
3. Run the make file using the terminal command 'make run' to open the simulation window
4. Click on the 'start' button to begin the simulation
5. Use the 'pause' button to pause the simulation. This will change to a 'resume' button to allow you to resume the simulation
6. Click the 'quit' button to end the simulation and the program
